H9KaqCBEvvg,"Nos quejamos durante años porque este proyecto no avanzaba, y una vez que se vuelve real, empiezan a criticar todo. Encima es solo un detrás de escena, ni siquiera se sabe si es una toma que va a quedar. Sean más contemplativos, queridos.",0,1
H9KaqCBEvvg,"Joder, que buenas carcajadas me he aventado con esto, los movimientos si son exagerados creo que hasta yo lo puedo mejorar, ahí hace falta practicar, por cierto Rami usa unos pantalones acampanados fuera de moda muy setenteros...Los de Freddie no eran así, la forma de moverse de John Deacon bien despreocupado va y toma su instrumento jaja y Roger ese peluquín(se ve de lejos) y medio enano al parecer tiene que dar grandes saltos hasta la batería para llegar, espero cambien esos detalles en la película final.",0,0
H9KaqCBEvvg,I'M CONFUSED. IS RAMI SINGING OR MARC MARTEL?,0,4

f5F2whaRzqw,"Nice Youtube. I've been thinking for a long time that microwave could be used for speaker feedback. This would work with just a comparator. I haven't been able to build it, not my field, but nice to know something like this exists.",0,0
f5F2whaRzqw,Step 1: Draw some eldritch symbols on the copper layer of a pcb.\nStep 2: Put some components randomly on that pcb.\nStep 3: Make an offering to the microwave god.\nStep 4: Profit!,1,1
f5F2whaRzqw,Physics is very interesting subject indeed! your videos have quality and my best wishes for the channel to have million subscribers.,0,1
f5F2whaRzqw,Great video Kerry. Assuming it can tune below 10.5 Ghz I see the foundation for an amateur transceiver.,0,1

5kZi3J2S52E,Nurd the acetone peak I bet is from your lab connection person cleaning the NMR tubes with acetone. Here in my lab we clean them with water then acetone then stick them in the oven. It's not uncommon for a little bit of acetone to be left over in the NMR spectrum,0,0

5kZi3J2S52E,"been watching this process the entire 2 years youve been working on it. and im no chemist. to be honest i barely follow the names of the chems you use to do this, but its satisfying to see the reactions. congrats from a regular joe man. you blew my mind on this one.",0,0
5kZi3J2S52E,Heres an idea. Platytoxin. Suppose to be a very hard chemical to sythansize :),0,0
5kZi3J2S52E,Fuck yes! Congratulations man!! Been a great journey watching this. Am so pleased it finally paid off!!,0,0
5kZi3J2S52E,Well done! I haven't been here for the whole process as a lot of organic reactions are a bit too complex for an amateur-amateur like me.\nBut anyone can see it's worth celebrating when you come out of two years research with a big green tick in the checkbox.\nKeep up the great work... you are the one person who made me realise that YouTube wan't just about pirated music videos and people hiding turds in each others lunchboxes.,0,0
